                The research lab focuses on designing technology to improve the life experience of autistic individuals.
                This technology addresses economic and socially-critical problems, such as creating accessible
                employment opportunities for autistic college students and real-time detection of stress and anxiety in
                autistic young adults to improve their mental health conditions.

            <div class="contentNested">
                <p>
                    A significant proportion of
                    autistic individuals are
                    considered 'non-verbal or minimally verbal' and have
                    difficulty expressing their emotions. Commercial
                    alternative and assistive communication (AAC)
                    applications are not only scarce, but also often ineffective
                    in aiding autistic individuals in expressing emotions due
                    to a minimal understanding of their unique needs and
                    preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, as part of my undergraduate research, I helped develop eXpress, a mobile application that
                    helps autistic individuals communicate their emotions through customizable symbolic representations
                    of
                    emotions via emoticons, musical notes, auditory feedback, and color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This resulted in a poster publication at UbiComp 2022:

            <div class="contentNested">
                <p>
                    One of the research projects featured biological data collection (including GPS and Heart rate
                    variability) using smartwatches.
                    For some time, data collection was interrupted, and I was assigned to the project to discover the
                    reason for the interruption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cause turned out to be the serverless solution that the smartwatch sent data to through an
                    HTTP request, which then formatted the data and sent it to the database. The free tier that was
                    hosting our apps was sunset (discontinued) and all the apps were deleted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My contribution was using my then-recently-acquired Azure Fundamentals certification to recreate the
                    entire deleted codebase using Azure Function Apps, updating the HTTP endpoints, and then testing to
                    ensure that the format in the database was still consistent.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Panic Pal is a React Native application with ChatGPT integration I'm working on for my CSCI 536:
                Technology for Social Good
                class.

                Panic attacks are sudden psychological episodes that have frightening symptoms such as shortness of
                breath, palpitations, or a feeling of doom or loss of control. These intense episodes of fear and
                anxiety can lead to social isolation, impaired relationships,
                and reduced quality of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Breathing/grounding techniques and interventions help to alleviate these issues. These techniques can be
                hard to carry out
                by yourself. Our app aims to provide ease in
                managing panic attacks in the moment to empower individuals to better cope with and reduce the impact
                panic attacks can have on their life.
